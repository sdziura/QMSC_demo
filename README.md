# QMSC Demo: Hyperparameter Optimization and Model Training

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for hyperparameter optimization and model training using PyTorch Lightning, Optuna, and MLflow. The pipeline includes cross-validation, logging, and experiment tracking, making it suitable for reproducible research and production-ready workflows.

## Features

- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Uses Optuna to optimize model hyperparameters such as hidden layer sizes, batch size, and learning rate.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implements stratified K-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **Model Training**: Trains a neural network with configurable architecture using PyTorch Lightning.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logs metrics, parameters, and models to MLflow for easy tracking and visualization.
- **TensorBoard Integration**: Logs training and validation metrics to TensorBoard for detailed analysis.
